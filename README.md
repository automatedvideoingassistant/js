# AVA JavaScript Example App

This project is the AVA auto-tracking device revised in the JavaScript language with tensorflowjs.

AVA is an auto-tracking hardware device that connects to an app via bluetooth and uses computer vision to keep a subject in the middle of the screen. The main project uses a flutter app with Tensorflow Lite (TFLite). In this repo, we are experimenting with TFJS and webBLE.
